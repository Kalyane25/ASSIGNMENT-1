    "Qualitative Data\n",
    "Qualitative data is descriptive and categorical. It describes qualities, characteristics, or properties that cannot be measured directly with numbers. This type of data often answers questions like “what,” “how,” or “why,” providing a deeper understanding of the subject rather than numerical analysis.\n",

    "Characteristics:\n",
    "Often non-numerical and descriptive.\n",
    "Captures concepts, ideas, or opinions.\n",
    "Is typically collected through interviews, surveys, and observations.\n",
    "Types of Qualitative Data:\n",
    "Nominal Data: Categorical data without a specific order. Examples: colors (red, green, blue), gender (male, female), or marital status (single, married).\n",
    "Ordinal Data: Categorical data with a defined order but no specific numerical value for the difference between categories. Examples: levels of satisfaction (satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied) or rankings (first, second, third).\n",
